The database is designed to efficiently manage and organize the different components of an apartment complex. Blocks represent the physical divisions within the complex, each containing multiple Apartments. These apartments can either be vacant or occupied by Residents, who are assigned a unique ResidentID. The relationship between Apartments and Residents is one-to-one, ensuring that each apartment has only one associated resident at a time, whether they are owners or tenants. The ApartmentStatus field helps in distinguishing between occupied and vacant apartments.

Residents also play a central role in the system, as they are responsible for making Payments for administrative services or maintenance. Each payment is tracked with details like the amount, payment date, and status, ensuring accountability and easy tracking of pending and completed transactions. The system also handles Reservations for common spaces such as gyms, pools, and event rooms. These spaces are stored in the CommonSpaces entity, which manages details like capacity and availability, while Reservations track who has booked which space, along with start and end times.

The platform also supports community communication through the Announcements entity. This allows the administration or residents to post important messages, such as event updates or maintenance schedules, which can be viewed by all residents. Additionally, the RightsAndDuties entity ensures transparency by outlining the roles and responsibilities of both the administration and the residents, providing a clear understanding of communal expectations. By keeping fields such as dates, amounts, and statuses NOT NULL, the system maintains high data integrity, ensuring that essential details are always captured and preventing incomplete records.
