## Project Description

This project focuses on designing and implementing an **Entity-Relationship (ER) model** for *Twitch*, a live-streaming platform. The goal is to structure and visualize the database by representing key entities such as **Users**, **Streams**, **Subscriptions**, **Donations**, and more, alongside their relationships. The project also involves creating a detailed **report** and a **poster** that showcase the ER model and its applications within the business.

### Objectives

- To design a comprehensive **Entity-Relationship Diagram** for the platform, including core components like users, streams, subscriptions, and interactions.
- To develop a **report** outlining the design process, decisions made, and the functionality of the model.
- To create a **poster** summarizing the ER model, highlighting the most important aspects of the platform’s data structure.

## Project Components

### 1. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**:
   - The ERD visually represents all major entities within the *Twitch* platform.
   - Key entities include:
     - **User**: Represents streamers and viewers, categorized by account type.
     - **Stream**: Captures live broadcast information, including title and view count.
     - **Video (VOD)**: Manages recorded streams, including upload details.
     - **Subscription**: Tracks user subscriptions and their types.
     - **Donation**: Represents viewer donations and interactions.
   - Relationships between entities depict real-world interactions such as users subscribing to streams and donating during broadcasts.

### 2. **Report**:
   - The report elaborates on the design of the ER model, explaining the choices made for entity attributes and relationships.
   - The structure of the report includes:
     - Introduction to the *Twitch* platform.
     - Step-by-step design of the ER diagram.
     - Detailed explanation of each entity and its attributes.
     - Discussion on how the model can be used to manage user interactions, track streams, and handle monetization processes.

### 3. **Poster**:
   - A visual summary of the ER model.
   - The poster presents the ER diagram, accompanied by brief descriptions of key entities and their relationships.
   - It highlights the most important features of the model, such as **user engagement** and **monetization strategies**.

## Features of the ER Model

- **User Management**: 
   The model efficiently manages user profiles, including streamers and viewers, ensuring streamlined interactions.

- **Streaming and Video Management**: 
   It allows tracking of live broadcasts and recorded content, facilitating easy access to past streams.

- **Monetization Tracking**: 
   By managing subscriptions, donations, and ads, the model helps keep a structured record of revenue sources.

- **Community Engagement**: 
   The design supports real-time interactions via chats, enhancing viewer engagement and community building.

- **Scalability**: 
   The design can be expanded to include additional features such as analytics, advanced moderation tools, and personalized content recommendations.

## Future Work

- **Integration with a Database Management System (DBMS)**:  
   The next step is to implement this ER model into a relational DBMS like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

- **Extension for Advanced Features**:  
   Future versions may include more comprehensive analytics, improved moderation tools, and enhanced user personalization to enrich the platform.
